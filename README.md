## Rationalle

In a world increasingly-connected by the Internet, the World Wide Web has emerged as a nearly-ubiquitous platform for personal communication, business operations, and global information sharing.

Any student of a technological field-and especially students of computer science/engineering-would be well-served by developing an understanding of the web and a proficiency in creation of the applications that it enables.

## Course Aims and Outcomes 
### Aims
As a result of participating in this course, students will be able to explain the various elements of the web ecosystem, demonstrate proficiency in the fundamental languages of web programming, and create web applications using contemporary tooling in preparation for a career involving web development. 

### Specific Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will: 
...

## Format and Procedures
This course meets once per week for a 3.5-hour period without an additional lab component. This course is intended to reflect industry norms as much as possible; to that end, project delivery and collaboration are emphasized over attendance and summative assessment.

## Assumptions
This course has no prerequisite courses; however, students are expected to be proficient in general programming principles and able to code in at least one language. Such experience will ensure that students are able to expediently learn new programming languages as they are introduced in this course.

No web development experience is required; this course assumes that students do not have any prior knowledge of the subject matter. 

Note that this is not a web *design* course. Presentation is covered and general design tools will be discussed, but the emphasis is on application programming using the web as a platform.

## Course Requirements
Tasks and assignments are intended to align with the learning outcomes specified above.

### Class attendance and participation policy

Attendance is not a graded component of this class, though students are encouraged to attend all lectures to fully benefit from the delivered lectures and peer discussion. 

### Course readings

In adhering to "real-world" industry norms, this class does not have any required texts, as all course material can be obtained through various free online resources. However, various readings will be recommended during the course of this class and will likely be helpful to student learning.
